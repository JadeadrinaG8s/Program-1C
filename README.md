AIM:Write a C program to check even or odd numbers using conditional operators.
ALGORITHM:
1)take a number as input from the user.2) check if the number is divisible by 2.3)print even if it is divisible using printf() function.
PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    if(a%2==0)
    {
        printf("The number is EVEN");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("The number is ODD");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
OUTPUT:
<img width="737" height="291" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-19 191642" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dbe8789-60bb-46b4-b216-9420a578a6cc" />
